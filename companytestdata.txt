It manages inventory, availabilities, contact details, price quotations, purchase and sales orders as well as many of the back office accounting details. Great product! 
##### Linda Pickard
TRUE NORTH COMPONENTS, Manager
CORtracker has been an integral part of our company’s foundation, growth and help in sales. The audit trail it provides is incomparable to all other systems I’ve used. Also, the support team is phenomenal. They have had some recent transitions in their upper management; but, it was all quite transparent. Even with us on the west coast and them on the east coast we are still being covered quite quickly if a problem arises.
